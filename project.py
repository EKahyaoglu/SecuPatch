Description:
    Streamlit-based dashboard that checks for server patch compliance.
    Users are expected to upload a YAML path manifest (.yaml/.yml) and a CSV log of patches (.csv) applied.
    The app evaluates which servers are compliant or non-compliant based on the inputs.
    The output will show results in visualizations and allows the user to download a compliance report (in PDF).
